	 * following conditions which have priorities as follows, ordered from most
	 * important to least important:
	 * 
	 * 1. The drone charges to a lighthouse by taking that direction. 2. The drone
	 * is not in charging range of any feature or in charging range of a feature
	 * with no coin and power values by taking that direction. 3. The drone moves to
	 * a valid position.
	 * 
	 * The method then calls the updateState() method to update the attributes
	 * describing its current state with the most favourable non-empty set of
	 * direction(s) it computed, returning the Direction object representing the
	 * direction the drone takes in this move.
