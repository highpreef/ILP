The task for the Informatics Large Practical is to develop an autonomous (“smart”) component which is
to play against a human component in a location-based strategy game. The smart component is an autonomous drone which competes against a human player who is acting as the pilot of a remote-controlled
(“dumb”) drone which moves only in response to directions from the pilot.

The autonomous drone and the player controlling the remote-controlled drone are playing a location-based
game where the goal is to collect cryptocurrency coins and power from virtual charging stations which have
been distributed around the University of Edinburgh’s Central Area. Your implementation of the drone
should be considered to be a prototype in the sense that you should think that it is being created with the
intention of passing it on to a team of developers who will maintain and develop it further. For this reason,
the clarity and readability of your code is important. Given that it is based on collecting coins and power,
and as we all know, money is power, the game is called PowerGrab.
